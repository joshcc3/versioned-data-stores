This looks really promising, bit of a warning sign is that its latest commit was more than a month ago 
and the density of recent commits is quite low.

The project doesn't work with <=1.7.6; I used go 1.9.1 to compile. I also had to set the `GOROOT` to `GOPATh`.
You also need to add $GOPATH/bin to your path.


Ok, I've got the example mentioned in the tutorial working.
